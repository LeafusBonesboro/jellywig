## âœ… WHAT'S DECIDED SO FAR

* Rebuild from scratch using Next.js instead of React+Flask
* Use Neon for token and data storage
* Reuse existing Yahoo app credentials
* Only update redirect URI for new deployment
* UI/UX will be prioritized before coding

## âœ… RECENT PROGRESS

* Clarified tech stack direction
* Confirmed Neon database
* Identified need for new redirect URI
* Established intention to focus on personal team data first

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS (Immediate)

* [x] Create project notes document (this file)
* [x] Draft README.md
* [ ] Define MVP dashboard layout (what shows first?)
* [ ] Name the project (optional for now)
* [ ] Initialize Next.js project locally
* [ ] Set up `.env.local` with placeholder variables

---

## ðŸ“Œ FUTURE TASKS (Post-MVP Layout)

* Create OAuth route: `/api/auth/yahoo`
* Add Neon DB connection + token table
* Store access & refresh tokens with expiry
* Fetch and display personal team PF/PA + standings
* Build Dashboard Page (Week-by-week and totals)
* Build League Overview Page (sortable standings + luck index)

## ðŸ§  IMPORTANT NOTES / REMINDERS

* Redirect URI must match exactly in Yahoo app settings
* Avoid spaghetti structure: modular helpers (DB, Yahoo API)
* Focus on personal team view first
* UI first, features second
* Keep everything incremental and clean
